# LQA Demo Loop

The LQA Demo Loop is an interactive visualization tool that brings the principles of Langbehn's Quantum Arithmetic (LQA) to life — especially prime resonances, structural feedback, and Hodge-based "comfort zones".

---

## 💡 Features

- **Prime Spiral:**  
  Displays prime numbers as structured spiral resonances

- **Flow Field:**  
  Navier–Stokes-like dynamic feedback overlay

- **Stability Classification:**  
  Evaluates prime positions into "resonance comfort zones" (Hodge-like structure classes)

---

## 🧪 Installation

### Requirements

```bash
pip install pyqt5 matplotlib numpy
```

---

## ▶️ Run

```bash
python main.py
```

A PyQt window will launch showing the full demo loop.

## 📊 Scientific Background

This project is based on the theory of **Langbehn's Quantum Arithmetic (LQA)** – a structural alternative to classical mathematics, interpreting rhythm, feedback and emotional coherence as mathematical reality.
